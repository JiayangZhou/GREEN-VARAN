The GREEN-DB
============

GREEN-DB is a comprehensive collection of potential regulatory regions in the human genome
including ~2.4M regions from 16 data sources and covering ~1.5Gb evenly distributed across chromosomes.
The regulatory regions are grouped in 5 categories: 

+------------+------------+---------------+
| GREEN-DB   | Value      | Bases covered |
+============+============+===============+
| N Enhancer | 1832830    | 1449153178    |
+------------+------------+---------------+
| N Promoter | 565323     | 234315553     |
+------------+------------+---------------+
| N Silencer | 4302       | 11210309      |
+------------+------------+---------------+
| N Bivalent |  8409      |894792         |
+------------+------------+---------------+
| N Insulator| 23         | 17504         |
+------------+------------+---------------+
|All regions | 2410887    | 1502180018    |
+------------+------------+---------------+

Each region is described by its genomic location, region type, method(s) of detection, data source and closest gene; 
~35% of regions are annotated with controlled genes, ~40% with tissue(s) of activity, and ~14% have associated phenotype(s).
GREEN-DB is available as an SQLite database and regions information with controlled genes are also provided as 
extended bed files for easy integration into existing analysis pipelines. 

Information in the database

SQLite database structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SQLite database contains 16 tables:

- GRCh37 / GRCh38 regions 
    GREEN-DB regions coordinate; region type; constraint percentile; closest gene symbol, Ensembl ID and distance; PhyloP100 statistics
- Tissues
    tissue(s) of activity for a region or a region-gene interaction
- Genes
    controlled gene(s)
- Methods
    method(s) supporting each region and region-gene interaction. This may correspond to the data source when no specific method information was available.
- Phenotypes
    potentially associated phenotypes
- GRCh37 / GRCh38 TFBS
    transcription factor binding sites
- GRCh37 / GRCh38 DNase
    DNase hypersensitivity peaks
- GRCh37 / GRCh38 dbSuper
    super-enhancers as defined by dbSuper
- GRCh37 / GRCh38 LoF_tolerance
    the probability of LoF tolerance for enhancers
- GRCh37 / GRCh38 UCNE
    ultraconserved noncoding elements

Main tables (regions, tissues, genes and methods) are linked by the unique region ID.
Additionally, a unique interaction ID identifies each gene-region pair in the gene table and itâ€™s linked to methods and tissues tables.
Linking tables are included that map the overlap between GREEN-DB region IDs and each of TFBS, DNase, dbSuper and LoF_tolerance region IDs, reporting also the fraction of overlap.

The constraint metric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For each region we calculated a contraint metric representing the tolerance to genetic variations.
Constraint ranges 0-1 with higher values associated to higher level of variation constraint.
Regions with high constraint values (especially > 0.9) are more likely to control essential genes and genes involved in human diseases.

Summary of the building process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In GREEN-DB we collected and aggregated information from 16 different sources, including

- 7 previously published curated databases
- 6 experimental datasets from recently published articles
- predicted regulatory regions from 3 different algorithms

Four additional datasets were included to integrate region to gene / phenotype relationships. 
We also collected additional data useful in evaluating the regulatory role of genomic regions, including 
- TFBS and DNase peaks
- ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNE)
- super-enhancer definitions
- enhancer LoF tolerance
